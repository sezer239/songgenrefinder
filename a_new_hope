To your grave, I spoke
Holding a red, red rose
Gusts of freezing cold air
Whispers to me, that you are gone
Always, always asking questions whay
My life is overrated but I
Never, never expected that I'd
Underestimated my love for you
To your grave, I spoke
Holding a red, red rose
Gusts of freezing cold air
Whispers to me, you are gone
Always, always just out of reach from my
Over-frustrated, shameful hands
And I never, never expected that I
Would ever, no never, take for granted our precious time
To your grave, I spoke
Holding a red, red rose
Gusts of freezing cold air
Whispers to me you're gone
Spent a lifetime of holding on just to let go
I guess I'll spend another lifetime
Searching for a new hope
To your grave, I spoke
Holding a red, red rose
Gusts of freezing cold air
Whispers to me you're gone
Spent a lifetime of holding on just to let go
I guess I'll spend another lifetime
Searching for a new hope
A new hope
A new hope
A new hope
A new hope
A new hope
